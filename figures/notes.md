## GIF Generation

1. Record Python Turtle window using Kazam and save the recording as MP4 file.
2. Convert MP4 to GIF using [mp4-2-gif](http://mp4-2-gif.com).

## Notes

* MP4 to GIF conversion using FFMPEG loses color quality somehow in our case.
* mp4-2-gif is relatively slow but maintains color quality.
